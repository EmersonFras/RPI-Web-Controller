# Raspberry Pi Display Project

This project is a personal endeavor to create a web-controlled display using a Raspberry Pi 4B, an Adafruit Bonnet, and a 64x64 RGB matrix. The setup hosts a web server that allows users to send requests to control the content displayed on the matrix. The web interface is built with React and React Router, offering an interactive way to manage the display.

## Features

- **Dynamic Display Control**: Use the web interface to control what is shown on the 64x64 RGB matrix.
- **Spotify Integration**: Sign in with your Spotify account to display any album cover on the matrix.
- **Web Server**: The Raspberry Pi runs a web server to handle requests from the React-based frontend.

## Technology Stack

- **Raspberry Pi 4B**: The central hardware for running the web server and controlling the display.
- **Adafruit Bonnet**: Facilitates connection and control of the 64x64 RGB matrix.
- **64x64 RGB Matrix**: The display hardware.
- **React**: For building the web interface.
- **React Router**: To manage navigation within the web interface.
- **Spotify API**: For fetching album cover images.

## Current Status

This project is a work in progress, and the following features are under development:

- Improved styling and layout for the web interface.
- Enhanced integration with Spotify for a smoother user experience.
- Additional display modes and customization options.
